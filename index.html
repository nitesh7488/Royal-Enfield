        <p>KTM-Sportmotorcycle AG is an Austrian motorcycle manufacturer, which was formed in 1992 but traces its foundation as early as in 1934. In 1992 the company was spun off from its parent company KTM when it ran into financial troubles. KTM was split into four companies, all of which shared the same KTM branding, and in present have many more subsidiaries with the same branding. However, KTM-Sport motorcycle is most commonly associated with the iconic KTM branding, because it still continues the flagship business of its parent company.
            KTM is known for its off road motorcycles though in recent years it has expanded into street motorcycle production and also developing a sports car.</p>

KTM 390 Duke Features: The KTM 390 Duke has always been a feature-rich motorcycle and gets an LED lighting system, a TFT screen along with Bluetooth connectivity, ride-by-wire and switchable ABS(including a Supermoto mode). In the latest iteration, the 390 Duke also gets a bi-directional quick-shifter.</td><br>

            <td>The entire range of KTM Duke motorcycles- have been updated with new colourways. Have a look at the new shades here. The bikes have started reaching dealerships too. See the photos here. KTM has been spotted testing a heavily revised 125 Duke, which features an updated frame, new sub-frame, new swingarm and revised powertrain. It is also expected to receive a thorough redesign to go with these updates. The 125 Duke stands as KTM's entry-level bike for the Indian two-wheeler market, a position formerly occupied by the KTM 200 Duke. It's styled to mimic the new Duke 200 and gets similar features, mechanicals, and a sophisticated liquid-cooled engine. The bike is available in two colour options: Electronic Orange and Ceramic White.</td><br>

            <td>The KTM 390 Duke is powered by a 373cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled motor producing the same power and torque figures of 43.5PS and 37Nm as it did in its previous iteration. KTM has revised the exhaust routing for its latest iteration -- it now runs below the engine and not around the cylinder heads. With that, the ground clearance of the KTM 390 Duke has taken a massive hit, slipping to 151mm from 175mm. There are no revisions to the six-speed gearbox with a slipper clutch. The addition of a bi-directional quickshifter adds to the sporty nature of the 390 Duke."</td><br>

                The KTM 890 Duke has been globally unveiled. It is essentially a bored-out version of the KTM 790 Duke with more power, improved electronics, better tyres and new colours. The only aspect differentiating the 890 Duke from the 790 is the new colour scheme. It sports the exact same bodywork with razor-sharp tank extensions and a full LED headlight. </td><br>
